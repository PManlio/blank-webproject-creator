# blank-webproject-creator

Every time I have to create a new web project -without using any particular php and/or js framework- I have to inizialize many things:
-> a folder with project's name
-> a folder for js files
-> a folder for css files + at least one .css file
-> (usually) an home.html file.

Too many things to do.
Oh, and let's not forget that we have to set <html> and <body> margin to 0 in css. Always the same thing.
So I'm creating this script to do all of these things by only writing project's name in the terminal.


Other informations soon.


UPDATE:


Now you can put blank.py directly in your /bin folder (Unix only) and write your project name side by side to the script name
